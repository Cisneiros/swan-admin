# Swan Admin

A simple administration interface for Express + Mongoose projects.

**Note:** I developed this initally as a personal project, and I haven't touched it for about a year. Although it still works, somethings are outdated, and some best practices were not followed. I plan on revisiting this at some point in the future for a major refactor.

## Installing

    npm install swan-admin

## Usage

Swan Admin is ment to be used with **existing Express applications**. It assumes you have a Mongoose connection configured and working somewhere. To configure Swan Admin, you just have to give it some information about your Models.

### Basic Configuration

This should go on your Express app code.

    // Require the module and install the middleware.
    // `User` and `Post` are instances of Mongoose.Model, in this example.

    var admin = require('swan-admin');
    app.use('/admin', admin({
        models: [User, Post],
        credentials: {
            username: process.env.ADMIN_USERNAME,
            password: process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD
        },
        sessionSecret: process.env.ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET
    }));

Swan Admin stores the authentication data on the **client**, securely. This means Swan Admin authentication is stateless, and can scale. It uses a Session Secret to encrypt the session data, before sending it to the browser. It is strongely adivised that you keep that in an environment variable, like `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` (as done above), whose value is a random string that only you know. The same applies to your credentials. If, for some reason, you cannot set these environment variable, you can pass the bare strings on the app configuration.

    app.use(adminMountPoint, admin({
        models: [User, Post],
        credentials: {
            username: 'boss',
            password: 'im-th3-b0ss'
        },
        sessionSecret: 'something-random-and-SECRET!'
    }));

### Advanced configuration

Each item on the `models` array can be either a `Mongoose.Model` or a Model Configuration Object (you can mix them). When you use a `Mongoose.Model`, Swan Admin will turn it into a Model Configuration Object with all the default options, and that is usually fine for simple use cases.

If you want a fine tuned administration interface, pass Model Configuration Objects instead. Each object can have the following properties (omitting any of them to use its default value).
    
    // Model Configuration Object:

    {
        mongooseModel: <Mongoose.Model>,  // the only MANDATORY item

        name: <String>,                   // human-readable name (defaults
                                          // to lowercase model name)

        pluralName: <String>,             // plural of `name` (defaults to
                                          // model name + 's')

        toString: <String>,               // model field to describe each
                                          // instance (defaults to 'id')
        // or
        toString: <Function>,             // takes a model instance and
                                          // returns a string

        fields: {<String>: <Object>},     // configure each model field
                                          // separately (defaults to {})

        explicitFieldsOnly: <Boolean>     // use only the fields specified in
                                          // `fields` above (defaults to false)
    }

The `fields` option is used to change a field behaviour. If you set `explicitFieldsOnly` to `true`, the `fields` also sets which model fields will be accessible on the admininstrator interface.

`fields` should be an object with model field names as keys and objects as values. The value object can be empty or have any of the following options (currently, there is only one option -- `editor`):

    // Field:

    {
        editor: <String>    // sets the HTML widget for this field (defaults
                            // to 'datetime' for dates, 'csv' for arrays, 
                            // 'json' for mixeds or 'textfield' for the rest)
                            // 
                            // possible values: 'textfield', 'textarea',
                            // 'markdown', 'datetime', 'csv' (comma-separated
                            // values), 'json'
    }

### Examples

Here are some examples of the `models` configuration:

    // Assuming these Mongoose.Model instances:
    // Post, User, Category

    [
        // Post model (adding extra configuration)
        {
            mongooseModel: Post,
            toString: 'title',
            fields: {
                content: {
                    editor: 'markdown'
                },
                teaser: {
                    editor: 'textarea'
                },
            }
        },

        // User model (disable seeing and editing the user's password)
        {
            mongooseModel: User,
            fields: {
                first_name: {},
                last_name: {},
                username {},
                bio: {
                    editor: markdown
                }
            },
            explicitFieldsOnly: true
        },

        // Category model (no extra configuration)
        Category
    ]


## Known Issues

**This project is still in early stages and it is incomplete!** It hasn't been fully tested and it is not feature-complete. This project began as an administration interface for a personal project, so it is not as general as it should be yet.

I plan to enhance Swan Admin and make it more general and more efficient. If you wan't to contribute, feel free to talk to me or send a pull request. :)

### Some features not yet implemented

* Paginate instance list
* Filter/search for instances
* Enhance visual interface
